        <h1 class="page-header">Fine Lines & Wrinkles</h1>

        <p class="section-text">You have probably heard “fine lines and wrinkles” used interchangeably, but there is actually some difference between the two! Not only do they appear in different areas of the face, but they are also treated differently, both in the types of facial rejuvenation procedures and products we recommend to you. Understanding the differences before you begin researching different treatment options will help you plan your appointment to our practice a little bit better.
        </p>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Fine lines</h2> often indicate the beginning of your skin’s aging process. They are small and shallow and may be hard to see initially. Fine lines on the face are often associated with repetitive movements, such as squinting, smiling, laughing or frowning. They are so superficial that they respond to treatments faster and easier than deeper wrinkles would.</li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Wrinkles</h2> form when fine lines are not treated quickly and begin to deepen, but they also tend to form in different areas of the face more quickly, often progressing into facial folds.</li>
        <p class="section-text">While these are often treated with <b>wrinkle relaxers</b>, like <b>BOTOX</b>® <b>Cosmetic</b> and <b>Dysport</b>, we also recommend using Retinol nightly and getting microneedling treatments.</p>
        <p class="section-text">Each patient’s unique anatomy will determine the specific treatment and skincare regimen we recommend to attain the best results!</p>

              <button class="accordion">What is BOTOX Cosmetic?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic is an injectable treatment made from botulinum toxin type A, a substance which temporarily relaxes the muscles responsible for causing lines and wrinkles to form. When BOTOX is injected into the face or neck, it relaxes lines and wrinkles as well as tightening sagging skin along the jawline.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Why choose Wellness District Aesthetics among the countless Fargo Moorhead area aesthetics practices?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>For starters, our practice is the #1 BOTOX provider in Santa Monica, CA. Nationally, we are ranked in the top 10 for Botox and Juvederm by their manufacturer Allergan.</p>
            <p>We specialize in injectables, and so our providers administer a higher volume of Botox treatments. In fact, we inject more in two weeks than most high performing dermatologists and plastic surgeons do in an entire year! Additionally, several of our Aesthetic Injection Specialists are National Trainers for Allergan. Our industry accolades are mirrored in our five star reviews and real patient results, clearly demonstrating why they continue to see us instead of choosing one of countless competing aesthetics practices across Los Angeles.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Are there ways to save on my BOTOX Cosmetic treatment?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, we accept Alle rewards! It’s free to join and you’ll earn points on every BOTOX Cosmetic, Kybella, or Juvederm treatments you receive! You will also receive points for every internal Latisse and SkinMedica purchase you make. Best of all, it’s free to join. You’ll be able to redeem points for future savings.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What about downtime, results and follow-up appointments for a wrinkle relaxer treatment?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The best part about a wrinkle relaxer treatment is that you will have no downtime and should be able to continue your day immediately after receiving your injections. Results vary but are usually visible by day seven. We may recommend a follow-up appointment to evaluate your results and, if necessary, administer a little more treatment.</p>
            <p>After three or four months, you will need a new treatment and can return to Skin by Lovely to maintain your fresh, youthful look.</p>
