        <h3 class="page-header-subheader">The NEW Revolutionary Fat-Freezing Machine Only at Wellness District</h3>

        <p class="section-text">CoolSculpting, the revolutionary body contouring treatment, hit the industry back in 2010. At the time, it was the only FDA-cleared treatment to reduce fat using the advanced cooling technology known as Cryolipolysis.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">The original CoolSculpting machine targets a stubborn bulge with one applicator, isolating a persistent bulge of fat. This applicator subjects the bulge to calibrated cold temperatures that effectively freeze the fat cells underneath without harming overlying skin or tissue.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">Afterward, the body’s immune system naturally gathers and disposes of the dead cells via the lymphatic system. Once fat cells are gone, they can never re-grow. CoolSculpting provides patients with natural-looking, long-lasting fat reduction results.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">While we have only great things to say about treating patients with the old CoolSculpting machine, as a Top 500 National Allergan Account, we decided to upgrade to the CoolSculpting Elite. Patients of the Elite have been so excited with the benefits: faster results, more fat reduction, and better sculpting. This is why we are excited to be the only clinic in the Fargo/Moorhead area with this brand new technology!
        </p>

        <h3>Top 5 Reasons the Elite CoolSculpting machine is now the only option for CoolSculpting
        </h3>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">25% More Fat Reduction</h2> - The new design of the ELITE applicators allows for better “tissue draw” (bringing fat up into the cold applicator’s center.) CoolSculpting ELITE removes 20-25% of unwanted fat – an improvement on the classic model, and the best fat-freeze stats on the market!
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">18% More Coverage</h2> - Elite covers up to 18% more skin surface, targeting more fat cells in the same treatment time. You get added CoolSculpting at no added cost.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Dual & QuadSculpting</h2> - Whereas the old model had one applicator, Elite has two. This means no more treatment rooms stuffed with CoolSculpting devices. We often use two ELITE devices to treat four body areas simultaneously. Our clients love the convenience of sculpting several fat “trouble areas” at the same time with CoolSculpting Elite.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">10 Years of Improvements</h2> - Elite is the culmination of 10+ years of CoolSculpting research, development, and widespread use. The device is now sleeker, more compact, and offers superior freezing technology.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">9 Treatment Areas</h2> - Customize away! Elite’s new “every size” applicators (pictured) get the job done with better fitting CoolSculpting. Freeze your stomach to your neck fat with never-before-seen precision.

              <button class="accordion">What is BOTOX Cosmetic?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic is an injectable treatment made from botulinum toxin type A, a substance which temporarily relaxes the muscles responsible for causing lines and wrinkles to form. When BOTOX is injected into the face or neck, it relaxes lines and wrinkles as well as tightening sagging skin along the jawline.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Why choose Wellness District?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>For starters, our practice is a Top 500 account with Allergan Aesthetics. We specialize in injectables, and our Providers administer a higher volume of Botox treatments because of this. Our industry accolades are mirrored in our five star reviews and real patient results. This demonstrates why people seeking Botox treatments continue to see us.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Are there ways to save on my BOTOX Cosmetic treatment?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Of course, we offer the Botox Club which patients can save $2/unit on their Botox treatment. Call for more information. We also accept Alle rewards! It’s free to join and you’ll earn points on every BOTOX Cosmetic, Kybella, CoolSculpting Elite or Juvederm treatments you receive! You will also receive points for every internal Latisse and SkinMedica purchase you make. Best of all, it’s free to join. You’ll be able to redeem points for future savings.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What about downtime, results and follow-up appointments for a Botox treatments?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The best part about a Botox treatment is that you will have no downtime and should be able to continue your day immediately after receiving your injections. We do recommend that you do not lie down for four hours following the treatment. We also recommend you do not work out the rest of the day. Results vary but are usually visible by day seven. Complete results can be seen by day 14. We may recommend a follow-up appointment to evaluate your results and, if necessary, administer a little more treatment.</p>
            <p>After three or four months, you will need a new treatment and can return to Wellness District to maintain your fresh, youthful look.</p>
