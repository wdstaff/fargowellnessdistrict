        <h3 class="page-header-subheader">The NEW Revolutionary Fat-Freezing Machine Only at Wellness District</h3>

        <p class="section-text">CoolSculpting, the revolutionary body contouring treatment, hit the industry back in 2010. At the time, it was the only FDA-cleared treatment to reduce fat using the advanced cooling technology known as Cryolipolysis.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">The original CoolSculpting machine targets a stubborn bulge with one applicator, isolating a persistent bulge of fat. This applicator subjects the bulge to calibrated cold temperatures that effectively freeze the fat cells underneath without harming overlying skin or tissue.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">Afterward, the body’s immune system naturally gathers and disposes of the dead cells via the lymphatic system. Once fat cells are gone, they can never re-grow. CoolSculpting provides patients with natural-looking, long-lasting fat reduction results.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">While we have only great things to say about treating patients with the old CoolSculpting machine, as a Top 500 National Allergan Account, we decided to upgrade to the CoolSculpting Elite. Patients of the Elite have been so excited with the benefits: faster results, more fat reduction, and better sculpting. This is why we are excited to be the only clinic in the Fargo/Moorhead area with this brand new technology!
        </p>

        <h3>Top 5 Reasons the Elite CoolSculpting machine is now the only option for CoolSculpting
        </h3>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">25% More Fat Reduction</h2> - The new design of the ELITE applicators allows for better “tissue draw” (bringing fat up into the cold applicator’s center.) CoolSculpting ELITE removes 20-25% of unwanted fat – an improvement on the classic model, and the best fat-freeze stats on the market!
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">18% More Coverage</h2> - Elite covers up to 18% more skin surface, targeting more fat cells in the same treatment time. You get added CoolSculpting at no added cost.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Dual & QuadSculpting</h2> - Whereas the old model had one applicator, Elite has two. This means no more treatment rooms stuffed with CoolSculpting devices. We often use two ELITE devices to treat four body areas simultaneously. Our clients love the convenience of sculpting several fat “trouble areas” at the same time with CoolSculpting Elite.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">10 Years of Improvements</h2> - Elite is the culmination of 10+ years of CoolSculpting research, development, and widespread use. The device is now sleeker, more compact, and offers superior freezing technology.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">9 Treatment Areas</h2> - Customize away! Elite’s new “every size” applicators (pictured) get the job done with better fitting CoolSculpting. Freeze your stomach to your neck fat with never-before-seen precision.
