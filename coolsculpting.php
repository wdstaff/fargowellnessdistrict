      <h2 class="listheader">COOLSCULPTING VS LIPOSUCTION</h2>
      <p>A method of fat removal, liposuction is a surgical procedure that requires individuals to undergo general anesthesia. It works by using large tubes to pull out fat from targeted areas of the body, leaving individuals with immediate results. However, it's an invasive procedure and can require a week or two of recovery. CoolSculpting doesn't require surgery and therefore has no downtime.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 class="listheader">COOLSCULPTING VS. DIET & EXERCISE</h2>
      <p>Your health - in addition to your appearance - is largely reliant on a well-balanced diet and regular exercise. CoolSculpting shouldn't take the place of either of these, but rather act as an aid that can help you accomplish your goals. Diet and exercise can help reduce the appearance of fat cells, but they don't permanently rid your body of them. CoolSculpting freezes off fat cells for good, enhancing your diet plan and serving as great encouragement for continuing a healthy lifestyle.</p>

      <h2 class="listheader listheaderspecial">YOUR FAT CELLS HATE THE COLD...<br>IT'S SCIENCE!!!</h2>
          <p>Freeze away fat? It comes down to science. Fat cells freeze at higher temperatures than surrounding tissues. CoolSculpting technology enables us to precisely target fat cells beneath the skin, and cool them to temperatures that trigger their natural death. This process, known as Cryolipolysis®, results in the treated fat cells becoming crystallized (frozen), and actually die. Because however the fats crystallize faster than normal cells, there is no damage to skin, nerves or other surrounding tissue. Over time as the treated fat cells shrink and die, your body naturally metabolizes them, eliminating these dead cells, and leaving a more sculpted you. Unlike with diet or exercise where the fat cells are reduced in size, with CoolSculpting, once the treated fat cells are gone, they're gone for good. With each session you are able to decrease the number of treated fat cells by about 20%. Each additional treatment further enhances your results, ridding you of an additional 20% of the treated fat cells per session. With CoolSculpting at Wellness District Aesthetics, it’s easy to sit back, relax and reduce that stubborn fat. Despite diet and exercise, fat cells accumulate in the body and can be very tough to get rid of. CoolSculpting technology uses controlled cooling (Cryolipolysis) to target, freeze, and kill only these fat cells. In the weeks to follow, these fat cells are naturally eliminated from the body. CoolSculpting results are long-term, as treated fat cells are gone for good.
