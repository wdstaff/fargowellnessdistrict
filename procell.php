        <p class="section-text">Procell is a micro-needling and micro-dermabrasion system in one package. The micro-channeling will keep your skin looking and feeling younger by activating your body’s natural regenerative ability to help tighten and lift skin, while minimizing many common skin problems.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">Micro-channeling stimulates your body’s natural ability to generate new health skin rather than utilizing destructive and inflammatory techniques like many treatments in the aesthetic industry. This results is a more enjoyable treatment, virtually non-existent downtime, and happier skin. Micro-channeling can also improve the overall health of your skin by stimulating the rejuvenation cascade for new collagen production.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">Procell serums contain growth factors derived from human bone marrow, which produce a potent, anti-inflammatory effect. This effectively reduces healing time, and can help improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation and scar tissue deposition. These growth factors support cellular renewal and have strong regenerating properties to improve skin firmness, elasticity, texture, and tone. This can diminish the prominence of scarring, fine lines, and wrinkles, leaving the skin looking and feeling bright and healthy.

              <button class="accordion">What is BOTOX Cosmetic?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic is an injectable treatment made from botulinum toxin type A, a substance which temporarily relaxes the muscles responsible for causing lines and wrinkles to form. When BOTOX is injected into the face or neck, it relaxes lines and wrinkles as well as tightening sagging skin along the jawline.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Why choose Wellness District?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>For starters, our practice is a Top 500 account with Allergan Aesthetics. We specialize in injectables, and our Providers administer a higher volume of Botox treatments because of this. Our industry accolades are mirrored in our five star reviews and real patient results. This demonstrates why people seeking Botox treatments continue to see us.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What about downtime, results and follow-up appointments for a Botox treatments?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The best part about a Botox treatment is that you will have no downtime and should be able to continue your day immediately after receiving your injections. We do recommend that you do not lie down for four hours following the treatment. We also recommend you do not work out the rest of the day. Results vary but are usually visible by day seven. Complete results can be seen by day 14. We may recommend a follow-up appointment to evaluate your results and, if necessary, administer a little more treatment.</p>
            <p>After three or four months, you will need a new treatment and can return to Wellness District to maintain your fresh, youthful look.</p>
