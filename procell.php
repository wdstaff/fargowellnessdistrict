          <p>ProCell MicroChanneling Stem Cell Therapy improves the clinical health and rejuvenation of your skin by stimulating your body’s natural biosignal response. It is a painless procedure with no downtime that addresses many skincare concerns, including fine lines, wrinkles, uneven skin tone, acne and acne scarring. With our stem-cell based MicroChannel Delivery System, your skin is stimulated to regenerate stronger and healthier than before!
            <br><br>Channeling is a 3 step painless skin rejuvenation procedure that create invisible micro-perforations in the skin to simulate cells (known as: keratinocytes) to increase production of new collagen and elastin. While lasers injure the skin, micro-channeling stimulates the release of epidermal growth factors without damaging the skin.

            <p><em>Age Spots</em><br>Micro-channeling aids in shedding the top layer of your skin to minimize age spots– which also helps your products abroad and work more efficiently.
              <br><br><em>Scars</em> <br>Micro-channeling has the ability to break upload scar tissue and stimulate collagen and elastin production that is similar in healthy skin tissue.

              <em>Acne</em><br>
Micro-channeling benefits acne by boosting the absorption and efficacy of topical acne products directly into the treated area.

<br><br><em>Premature Skin Aging</em><br>
Like how it helps with wrinkles, the same goes for preventing, as micro-channeling leads to thickening and preventing the breakdown of collagen. It also enhances the effectiveness of anti-aging products by boosting its absorption and concentration in your skin.

<em>Rosacea</em><br>
A skin disorder that produces facial redness that can lead to the breakdown of collagen– which can be helped through micro-channeling.

<br><br><em>Pore Size</em><br>
Reduces the size of pores– especially those around the nose and cheeks, by producing more collagen and thickening the epidermis layer of your skin.

<br><br><em>Stretch Marks</em><br>
Treating stretch marks with micro-channeling is similar to the way scars are treated– in the way that it breaks down stretch mark tissue and triggers collagen growth.

<br><br><em>Hyperpigmentation</em><br>
Triggered by an unusual production of melanin, micro-channeling helps to shed the top layer of skin to produce normal melanocyte. Unlike harsh treatments like lasers and microdermabrasion, micro-channeling is safe for anyone– especially those with darker skin tone, as it doesn’t lead to loss of skin pigment.
