        <h1 class="page-header">Cheek Enhancement & Revolumization</h1>

        <p class="section-text">The goal of cheek enhancement with dermal fillers is to add volume or lift the cheeks. As we age, we gradually lose facial volume. Our mid face and lower face is usually where this is seen most with “jowls”, sagginess, and deep nasolabial folds sometimes appearing. By injecting a hyaluronic acid based dermal filler such as Restylane Contour, Restylane Lyft, Juvederm Voluma, or Radiesse along the cheekbones and in the temples, we can help lift the entire lower face. The results are diminished jowling and softer nasolabial folds and a revolumization of the cheek area. This area can also be treated with Sculptra® Aesthetic, a poly-l-lactic acid that helps stimulate your skin’s own natural collagen production over time.

              <button class="accordion">What is BOTOX Cosmetic?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic is an injectable treatment made from botulinum toxin type A, a substance which temporarily relaxes the muscles responsible for causing lines and wrinkles to form. When BOTOX is injected into the face or neck, it relaxes lines and wrinkles as well as tightening sagging skin along the jawline.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Why choose Wellness District Aesthetics among the countless Fargo Moorhead area aesthetics practices?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>For starters, our practice is the #1 BOTOX provider in Santa Monica, CA. Nationally, we are ranked in the top 10 for Botox and Juvederm by their manufacturer Allergan.</p>
            <p>We specialize in injectables, and so our providers administer a higher volume of Botox treatments. In fact, we inject more in two weeks than most high performing dermatologists and plastic surgeons do in an entire year! Additionally, several of our Aesthetic Injection Specialists are National Trainers for Allergan. Our industry accolades are mirrored in our five star reviews and real patient results, clearly demonstrating why they continue to see us instead of choosing one of countless competing aesthetics practices across Los Angeles.</p>

          <button class="accordion">Are there ways to save on my BOTOX Cosmetic treatment?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, we accept Alle rewards! It’s free to join and you’ll earn points on every BOTOX Cosmetic, Kybella, or Juvederm treatments you receive! You will also receive points for every internal Latisse and SkinMedica purchase you make. Best of all, it’s free to join. You’ll be able to redeem points for future savings.</p>

          <button class="accordion">What about downtime, results and follow-up appointments for a wrinkle relaxer treatment?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The best part about a wrinkle relaxer treatment is that you will have no downtime and should be able to continue your day immediately after receiving your injections. Results vary but are usually visible by day seven. We may recommend a follow-up appointment to evaluate your results and, if necessary, administer a little more treatment.</p>
            <p>After three or four months, you will need a new treatment and can return to Skin by Lovely to maintain your fresh, youthful look.</p>
