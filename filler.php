        <p class="section-text">Dermal Fillers are made of hyaluronic acid (HA), a hydrating substance found naturally in your body. When injected just below the skin, this gel provides youthful plumpness and definition in precisely targeted areas. It also attracts water, which gives your skin an added glow.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">Wellness District has helped to redefine how people use Dermal Fillers in our area. Dr Berry has taken extensive training from Dr Mauricio de Maio and has brought the MD Codes to the Fargo/Moorhead area. A very limited number of clinics in the entire country are advanced enough to use these methods. The MD Codes is a system developed by Dr Mauricio de Maio to provide specific injection guidelines giving the precise location, layer, tool, delivery system, and product volume information to be used to achieve optimal results, regardless of patient age, gender, or ethnicity. No one will know, but everyone will ask why you look so good!
