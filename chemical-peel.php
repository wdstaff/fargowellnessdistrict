            <p> This treatment effectively treats a host of skin problems including acne, discolorations and fine lines and wrinkles. Most procedures take less than an hour to perform, with minimal discomfort during the treatment.<br><br>

              Chemical peels work inside-out to encourage cell stimulation, support collagen production and strengthen the skinâ€™s protective barrier to promote more youthful and healthier looking skin. As we age, our skin cell replenishing cycle slows down. A chemical peel eliminates the buildup of dead skin cells on the face, providing instant improvement.*<br><br>

              A series of 3 peels, 1 month apart, in conjunction with a home-care skin conditioning regimen provides the best overall results.</p>
