        <p class="section-text">The DiamondGlow Facial is a non-invasive combination facial and dermabrasion which deeply cleans and rejuvenates the appearance of your skin. This skin resurfacing procedure incorporates three effective techniques into a single treatment:
        </p>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Exfoliation:</h2> Removes dead skin cells that can make your skin look dull.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Extraction:</h2> Deeply cleanses the skin by removing dirt, oil, debris, and impurities from your pores.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Serum infusion:</h2> After your skin is resurfaced and cleared of impurities, it’s infused with a DiamondGlow serum that hydrates, nourishes, and brightens the skin.
        </li>



        <p class="section-text">The DiamondGlow dermabrasion device has a special wand that uses a diamond tip to gently remove dead skin cells on the outer layer of your skin. The diamond tip exfoliates the skin while high-powered suction deeply cleans your pores. As the handpiece moves across your skin, it exfoliates, extracts impurities, and infuses serum into your skin all at the same time.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">There are six diamond tips to choose from, and each one is designed for a specific skin type and texture. You’ll also choose from five different serums designed to target specific skincare concerns:
        </p>


        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Pore clarifying:</h2> An ideal treatment for acne-prone skin that deep cleans pores to promote clearer skin.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Ultra-hydrating:</h2> Infuses your skin with hyaluronic acid to boost hydration and promote smooth, soft skin.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Skin brightening:</h2> This serum is rich in peptides to promote a smooth, even skin tone and improve hyperpigmentation.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Vitamin C:</h2> Helps fight the signs of aging with a blend of antioxidants to rejuvenate your skin.
        </li>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">TNS Advanced +:</h2>This serum improves the tone and texture of your skin and reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles.
        </li>

        <p class="section-text">These options make your treatment fully customizable based on your unique skin type and cosmetic goals.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">Before your session begins, your skin is cleansed and prepped for treatment. To help you track your progress, DiamondGlow before and after photos may be taken. Your provider chooses the diamond tip and DiamondGlow serum that best meets your skin type and specific skincare concerns. Then, your provider carefully moves a motorized handpiece over the surface of your skin. Each pass over your skin gently removes dead skin cells, deeply cleans your pores, and infuses the serum into your skin.

              <button class="accordion">What is BOTOX Cosmetic?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic is an injectable treatment made from botulinum toxin type A, a substance which temporarily relaxes the muscles responsible for causing lines and wrinkles to form. When BOTOX is injected into the face or neck, it relaxes lines and wrinkles as well as tightening sagging skin along the jawline.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Why choose Wellness District?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>For starters, our practice is a Top 500 account with Allergan Aesthetics. We specialize in injectables, and our Providers administer a higher volume of Botox treatments because of this. Our industry accolades are mirrored in our five star reviews and real patient results. This demonstrates why people seeking Botox treatments continue to see us.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Are there ways to save on my BOTOX Cosmetic treatment?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Of course, we offer the Botox Club which patients can save $2/unit on their Botox treatment. Call for more information. We also accept Alle rewards!

          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What about downtime, results and follow-up appointments for a Botox treatments?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The best part about a Botox treatment is that you will have no downtime and should be able to continue your day immediately after receiving your injections. We do recommend that you do not lie down for four hours following the treatment. We also recommend you do not work out the rest of the day. Results vary but are usually visible by day seven. Complete results can be seen by day 14. We may recommend a follow-up appointment to evaluate your results and, if necessary, administer a little more treatment.</p>
            <p>After three or four months, you will need a new treatment and can return to Wellness District to maintain your fresh, youthful look.</p>
