            <p>Diamond Glow® is a fully customizable treatment in which combines exfoliation, extraction, and infusion of condition-specific serums to help improve the skin inside and out. Be it acne, fine lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, blackheads or other ailments commonly affecting the skin on the face or body, the Diamond Glow® process delivers specially formulated solutions deep into the skin without damaging its natural structure, and provides a greater level of exfoliation. Diamond Glow® uses controlled vacuum pressure to pull the skin up into a chamber in the hand piece where the diamond abrasive tip evenly and consistently removes the stratum corneum. Because of Diamond Glow’s distinctive simultaneous technology, plumpness, volume, hydration, tone, and texture are optimized. It is customizable, effective and may offer immediate results with no downtime.
