        <h1 class="page-header">Diamond Glow Facial</h1>

        <p class="section-text">The DiamondGlow Facial is a non-invasive combination facial and dermabrasion which deeply cleans and rejuvenates the appearance of your skin. This skin resurfacing procedure incorporates three effective techniques into a single treatment:
        </p>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Exfoliation:</h2> Removes dead skin cells that can make your skin look dull.</li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Extraction:</h2> Deeply cleanses the skin by removing dirt, oil, debris, and impurities from your pores.</li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Serum Infusion:</h2> After your skin is resurfaced and cleared of impurities, it’s infused with a DiamondGlow serum that hydrates, nourishes, and brightens the skin.</li>

        <p class="section-text">The DiamondGlow dermabrasion device has a special wand that uses a diamond tip to gently remove dead skin cells on the outer layer of your skin. The diamond tip exfoliates the skin while high-powered suction deeply cleans your pores. As the handpiece moves across your skin, it exfoliates, extracts impurities, and infuses serum into your skin all at the same time.</p>
        <p class="section-text">There are six diamond tips to choose from, and each one is designed for a specific skin type and texture. You’ll also choose from five different serums designed to target specific skincare concerns:</p>

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Pore Clarifying:</h2> An ideal treatment for acne-prone skin that deep cleans pores to promote clearer skin.</li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Ultra-Hydrating:</h2> Infuses your skin with hyaluronic acid to boost hydration and promote smooth, soft skin.</li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Skin Brightening</h2> This serum is rich in peptides to promote a smooth, even skin tone and improve hyperpigmentation.</li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Vitamin C</h2> Helps fight the signs of aging with a blend of antioxidants to rejuvenate your skin.</li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">TNS Advanced+</h2> This serum improves the tone and texture of your skin and reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>

        <p class="section-text">These options make your treatment fully customizable based on your unique skin type and cosmetic goals.</p>

          <div class="panel">
            <p>Before your session begins, your skin is cleansed and prepped for treatment. To help you track your progress, DiamondGlow before and after photos may be taken. Your provider chooses the diamond tip and DiamondGlow serum that best meets your skin type and specific skincare concerns. Then, your provider carefully moves a motorized handpiece over the surface of your skin. Each pass over your skin gently removes dead skin cells, deeply cleans your pores, and infuses the serum into your skin.</p>

          <button class="accordion">During Your Treatment</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>You might feel a tingling or tightening sensation as the handpiece moves over your skin, but most patients feel little to no discomfort. An average treatment session takes about 30 minutes to complete. Since treatment is non-invasive, you can resume your normal activities after your treatment session ends.

          <button class="accordion">After Your Treatment</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>After your DiamondGlow treatment, you’ll notice visibly healthier, glowing skin that appears well-hydrated and has a smoother, more even skin tone. Many patients also notice firmer, plumper skin. After a series of treatments, you’ll notice smaller pores, less congested skin, fewer breakouts, and an improvement in the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, acne scars, and hyperpigmentation. It’s an ideal treatment before a special event that will make your skin look brighter and rejuvenated.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">See Continued Improvement</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>To see continued visible improvement in the appearance of your skin, we recommend receiving a series of treatments that are performed every three to four weeks. Your provider will design a personalized treatment plan that best meets your needs. DiamondGlow is safe and effective for all skin types, including sensitive skin. It can also be combined with a variety of cosmetic treatments and products to help you achieve your skincare goals.
