She has always had an interest in aesthetics-her mother was an esthetician growing up! During her internship in plastic surgery, she was able to participate not only in surgery but consults, skin care, injections, and lasers and this really solidified her decision on pursuing aesthetic nursing as a career. After graduating with her BSN, Megan accepted a job offer here in Fargo in general surgery at Sanford. With her background in surgery, she was able to use that knowledge and work alongside the plastic surgeons a large majority of the time. Megan was at Sanford for 2 years and began part-time at the Wellness District, very eager to learn, quickly picking up on things. A few months later, she joined the team, full time!

Her favorite products at WD are: TNS and Bye-Bye Dry and her favorite part about working at the clinic has been all the knowledge she has gained from Dr Berry and all the amazing patients she has been able to work with.
