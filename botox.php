        <p class="section-text">At Wellness District Aesthetics we use an innovative Botox® injection technique not used by any other clinic in the Fargo/Moorhead area. Our Botox® technique gives patients a natural yet flawless look. We take our time to ensure that our Botox® is strategically placed for each individual patient's anatomy.

        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">New Patient Special</h2> We are so confident in our techniques and precise placement that we offer patients their first Botox® treatment at Wellness District for <b>$150 (up to 35 units).</b></li>
        <li class="section-text section-text-li"><h2 class="midline-header">Botox</h2> is a purified protein derived from Botulin Toxin A. Botox® works by preventing the transmission of nerve impulses to the injected muscle therefore relaxing the facial movements that create facial lines. Botox® can be used to treat and prevent fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
        <p class="section-text">Both women and men can receive Botox® injections. Botox® is most commonly used to treat fine lines and wrinkles, but it is not for all types of fine lines and wrinkles. Our expert injectors will guide you towards the best treatment option for you.</p>
        <p class="section-text">Each patient’s unique anatomy will determine the specific treatment and skincare regimen we recommend to attain the best results!</p>

              <button class="accordion">What is BOTOX Cosmetic?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic is an injectable treatment made from botulinum toxin type A, a substance which temporarily relaxes the muscles responsible for causing lines and wrinkles to form. When BOTOX is injected into the face or neck, it relaxes lines and wrinkles as well as tightening sagging skin along the jawline.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Why choose Wellness District?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>For starters, our practice is a Top 500 account with Allergan Aesthetics. We specialize in injectables, and our Providers administer a higher volume of Botox treatments because of this. Our industry accolades are mirrored in our five star reviews and real patient results. This demonstrates why people seeking Botox treatments continue to see us.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Are there ways to save on my BOTOX Cosmetic treatment?</button>
          <div class="panel">

          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What about downtime, results and follow-up appointments for a Botox treatments?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The best part about a Botox treatment is that you will have no downtime and should be able to continue your day immediately after receiving your injections. We do recommend that you do not lie down for four hours following the treatment. We also recommend you do not work out the rest of the day. Results vary but are usually visible by day seven. Complete results can be seen by day 14. We may recommend a follow-up appointment to evaluate your results and, if necessary, administer a little more treatment.</p>
            <p>After three or four months, you will need a new treatment and can return to Wellness District to maintain your fresh, youthful look.</p>
